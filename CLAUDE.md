We are building a music player and library browsing application using C++, Qt6, QML, TagLib, and SQLite. Smoothness and continuity of the browsing experience are key goals. The app aims to emphsize visual richness by featuring album art prominently while maintaining high performance. 

Debugging output is logged to debug_log.txt. Delete the contents of this file before running the application if you need fresh debugging output.
To build, run cmake --build build
To run, run ./build/mtoc_app
