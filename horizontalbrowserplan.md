# Horizontal Browser Plan

The horizontal browser is an additional, supplementary album browser that shows all album covers in the libray a scrollable horizontal view. Albums are grouped by album artist, with album artists sorted alphabetically and albums within an artist sorted by year (as in the artists colum). 

It is placed in the library pane, above the artist list and below the header. 

Clicking on an album in the horizontal browser opens the track list in the tracks column. 

Clicking an album in the artist list jumps the active selection in the horizontal browser to that album. 

The horizontal browser implements a visual effect where the album covers are depicted in a way that gives the impression of a gallery of album covers where the currently selected album is centered, and the album covers to either side are viewed tilted inward and partially overlapping each other, with their edges visible. Scrolling causes the middle album to smoothly tilt as it moves to the side, and the album taking the center place smoothly tilts to a head-on perspective. The angle of the albums is mirrored from left to right. Retaining perspective continuity during scrolling, as albums move across the middle position and change their tilt angle, is important. This is the same effect as the CoverFlow view formerly used in iTunes.
